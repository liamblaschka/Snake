# Snake

## Description
A snake game coded in C++ using SFML.
The player uses the arrow keys to move the green snake with the goal of collecting as much fruit as possible. With each fruit eaten, the snake grows by one square, and 1 point is added to the score. The game is over if the snake hits the edge of the window/border or runs into its own body. The high score is saved between runs of the game.

## Instructions
- Make a build directory and within it run 'cmake ..' , then when it is finished, run 'make'.
- Navigate to the bin directory within build.
- Run the 'snake' executable.
